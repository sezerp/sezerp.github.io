About me is not a music  
More guesses than real thoughts  
It's not a theatre  
Only real world  

Whoever ask, it's science  
However, for me, It's mean too much  
Thinking, sounds enough  
Makes me going forwards  

Step by step  
Dearming about fly  
Don't tell me it's to far  
If you don't, leave my mind  

I am not afraid to stay alone  
Only with somone  
Pleas understan this simple think  
Although don't believe to it  

I would trust but how  
Everywhere unknowns  
The race between brain and thouths  
Constantly converge and blow  

Pleas change my mind, if you can  
Show me what is somewere else  
Because it's nothing above  
It's just a couple of words  
The only thing what is real it's sounds between us
