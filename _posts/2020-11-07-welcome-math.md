The Einstein field equations are as follows

$$R_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}\,,$$

where $$R_{\mu\nu}$$ is Ricci curvature, $$R$$ is scalar curvature, $$g_{\mu\nu}$$ is metric, $$G=6.67\times 10^{-11}$$ is the Newtonian constant of gravitation, $$c=2.99\times 10^{8}$$ is the speed of light in vacuum and $$T_{\mu\nu}$$ is the stress–energy tensor.
